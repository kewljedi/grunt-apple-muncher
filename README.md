## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.1`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-apple-muncher --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-apple-muncher');
```

## The "apple_muncher" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `apple_muncher` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  apple_muncher: {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    your_target: {
      // Target-specific file lists and/or options go here.
    },
  },
})
```

### Options

#### options.precomposed
Type: 'Boolean'
Default value: false

A value true will create files with precomposed in the file name which will prevent IOS from adding Rounded Corners, Drop Shadow, and Reflective Shine to your icon.


#### options.dest
Type: `String`
Default value: `dest/`

A string value indicating the path of the directory that will contain the generated files.

#### options.src
Type: `String`
Default value: `apple-touch-icon.png`

A string value that indicates the name of the file to be used as the bases for creating the other files. This file must be:
- at least 144 pixels wide
- a square
- a png 

### Usage Examples

#### Default Options
In this example, the default options are used to create the following files based on the src 'apple-touch-icon.png':
- apple-touch-icon-57x57.png
- apple-touch-icon-72x72.png
- apple-touch-icon-114x114.png
- apple-touch-icon-144x144.png

These files IOS will add Drop Shadow, Reflective Shine, and Rounded Corners to before displaying them.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  apple_muncher: {
    options: {}
  },
})
```
#### Precomposed Icons
In this example, the precomposed options is used to create the following files based on the src 'apple-touch-icon.png':
- apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-72x72-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-114x114-precomposed.png
- apple-touch-icon-144x144-precomposed.png

IOS will display these file without appying any changes.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  apple_muncher: {
    options: {
      precomposed:true
    },
    files: {
      'dest/default_options': ['src/testing', 'src/123'],
    },
  },
})
```
